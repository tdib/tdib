# Hi, I'm Tom!

I'm currently studying a Bachelor of Engineering (Computer and Network)/Bachelor of
Computer Science at RMIT, and am working as a Technology Associate at Commonwealth
Bank.

I really enjoy working with Rust and Svelte when I can get away with it, although I
will be happy enough in JavaScript land (TypeScript, JavaScript, NodeJS, and
*begrudgingly* React). If you really twist my arm I can also work with Java, Python
and C/C++.

When I'm not working you can find me playing the violin and running!
